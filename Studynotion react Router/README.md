# React Router Project Starter
This project is an intermediate-level React application focused on implementing authentication flows using React Router, inspired by Love Babbar’s teaching style and logic patterns.

The module demonstrates a real-world login & signup flow for two user roles:
✔ Students
✔ Instructors

It is part of a bigger LMS-style platform known as StudyNotion.


✨ Project Description :-)

The goal of this project is to build a modular, clean, and scalable Authentication System using:

React Router (Intermediate Level)

Protected Routes

Role-based Navigation

State Management

Reusability & Component-Based Structure

This project includes:

🔐 Authentication Screens

Signup Page – For both Students & Instructors

Login Page – Email/Password authentication

👤 Role-Based User Flow

After login:

Student gets redirected to the Student Dashboard

Instructor gets redirected to the Instructor Dashboard

🔄 Dynamic Routing

React Router is used for:

Navigation

ProtectedRoute wrappers

Redirects based on login state

Role-based access control

🧩 Form Handling

Forms are validated using:

Controlled inputs

Basic field validation (email format, password length, role selection)

Error state handling.

🚀 What I Learned :-)
